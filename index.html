          <h2>“He’d slept through most of the 19th century, for example. Not because he needed to, but simply because he enjoyed it. One of the pleasures in the world. Well, he’d better start really enjoying them now, while there was still time.” (37)</h2>
            <ul>
              This mindset if enjoying the time we have now is something that a lot of people take for granted. In today’s world, there are so many thinkers, dreamers and doers of tomorrow, which is okay in a sense. But what about today? What about enjoying the time we have now. For a lot of people, it’s hard to let go and just embrace the moment and take life as it comes. This is important however, because our lives are but a mist and can be taken at any moment.

          <h2>“ ‘The way I see it,’ said Crowley, ‘no one has to pull the trigger.’ ” (107)</h2>
            <ul>
              This quote from Crowley shows that no one has to to end the world. It suggest that the world should remain on its own course and that its fate is in the hands of humans and not supernatural forces. Humans should be wary of their environment and do what is best in the interests of the planet.

          <h2> “You can’t start someone off in a muddy shack in the middle of a war zone and expect them to do as well as someone born in a castle. Ah, Aziraphale had said, that’s the good bit. The lower you start, the more opportunity you have.” (39)</h2>
            <ul>
              This quote in particular addresses an area of particular relevance in today's world. One of the issues that has long been debated, but has especially come to fruition as of late, is in regards to how much parents should give their kids. Now, this isn’t to say that parents shouldn’t provide their kids the best opportunities, but giving it all to them, so that they don’t have anything to put their name on based off their own merit is too far. We live in an age where kids can now get “a small loan of a million dollars”. Obviously, just because somebody is given a million dollars doesn’t necessarily mean they’re entitled or going to just sit on that and collect the rest of their life, but I think it does speak to the age we live in. Conversely, you have those who work their tails off just to make lives for themselves. In doing so, they learn the values of hardwork and effort. Again, nothing against giving the best you can for your kids, but we as a population cannot be handed everything as this quote so perfectly displays.

        <h2> “ ‘I don’t see how they could have messed it up,’ said Crowley. ‘I mean two babies. It’s not exactly taxing, is it…?’ ” (86)
</h2>
          <ul>
This quote shows how close the world was to ending. The swap of two babies could have changed the course of history for the humans on the planet. There was a fifty-fifty chance that the world could end. however , the human race was lucky that the simple swap failed even due to its simplicity. This is similar to the current state of the world in which the simple misunderstanding could lead to a nuclear disaster due to the current technologies at hand.           </ul>

      <h2> “He'd found that even the people whose job of work was, so to speak, the Universe, didn't really believe in it and were actually quite proud of not knowing what it really was or even if it could theoretically exist.
”
</h2>
        <ul>
Essentially this quote is saying that even most intellectual people and those who have it “figured out” don’t even begin to understand or know the ways of the universe. More often than not, it’s better to accept the mysterious ways in which the universe moves and keep on living life. There are so many things that are above us that don’t even concern us. When we get caught up in trying to pursue the mysteries and hidden truths.    </div>

    <h2> "I bet you don't have to be Spanish to be the Spanish Inquisition," said Adam. "I bet it's like Scottish eggs or American hamburgers. It just has to look Spanish. We've just got to make it look Spanish. Then everyone would know it's the Spanish Inquisition." (Thursday)

</h2>
      <ul>
        This quote from the book shows that the impression is what matters. It does not matter what you create things to be, rather it matters how one defines the creations.

  <h2> “ 'But you can't just leave it at that!' said Anathema, pushing forward. 'Think of all things you could do! Good things!'' 'Like what?' said Adam suspiciously.” (Saturday)


</h2>
    <ul>
      The idea that all humans can choose to do good or bad is seen throughout this quote. As noted from the start, Adam would in fact have the power to save or destroy the world. Despite being the antichrist, he ends up saving it. While there is no definitive antichrist in today’s world, it is true in the sense that we all have the natural ability to do good or bad. Ultimately, it is how we are raised and grown that influences us and our decisions that we make.

  <h2> “Maybe it's all part of a great big ineffable plan. All of it. You, me, him, everything. Some great big test to see if what you've built all works properly, eh? You start thinking: it can't be a great cosmic game of chess, it has to be just very complicated Solitaire. And don't bother to answer. If we could understand, we wouldn't be us. Because it's all — all — INEFFABLE,” said the figure feeding the ducks.” (389)

</h2>
    <ul>
      This quote is found in some of the final pages of this book. It embodies one of the central ideas that this book portrays, in that, there is a bigger plan going on. The plan being the devil trying to end the world through Adam, the antichrist. In the end, the plan fails as Adam saves the world with his supernatural; powers. Regardless of whether you believe in the higher powers and the orchestrating of our lives, this goes to show that there is so much more to life and there’s some stuff we will never understand being the creatures we are.
